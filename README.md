# String-Decryptor
The implementation of a program that decodes a series of strings coded by different cryptographic methods.
The requirement is to find out what the decoding method is and implement it.

The coding methods are:

1. XOR between two strings of bytes
2. rolling XOR
3. XOR between two strings represented through hexadecimal characters
4. base32
5. bruteforce on XOR with one byte key
6. Vigenere Cipher
